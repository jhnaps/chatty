// 149 Order with respect to common property rights by-laws
//      (1) The Tribunal may make an order prescribing a change to a by-law
//      if the Tribunal finds--
//           (a) on application made by an owner of a lot in a strata
//           scheme, that the owners corporation has unreasonably
//           refused to make a common property rights by-law, or

//      is to preside at any meeting at which the chairperson is present.
//      (2) Presiding member where chairperson absent In the chairperson's
//      absence from a meeting, the persons present at that meeting and
//      entitled to vote on motions submitted at that meeting (other than
//      unfinancial owners) may elect one of their number to preside at that
//      meeting and the person so elected is, while so presiding, taken to be
//      the chairperson of the owners corporation.
//      (3) Chairperson does not have casting vote The chairperson does not
//      have a casting vote in relation to any motion but may vote in his or
//      her own right if otherwise entitled.
//      (4) Chairperson may be only person present A meeting is, subject to
//      the provisions of this Schedule relating to the quorum, validly held
//      even though the only person present at the meeting is the chairperson
//      of the owners corporation.
// 13 Chairperson to announce names of persons entitled to vote
// If requested to do so by a person present and entitled to vote at a meeting,
// the chairperson must, before submitting a motion to the meeting or the holding
// of the election of members of the strata committee, announce the names of the
// persons who are entitled to vote on that motion or at that election.
// 14 Decisions at meetings
//      (1) Simple majority vote to generally apply A motion put to a
//      meeting, or an election of officers of the owners corporation or
//      members of the strata committee, is to be decided according to a
//      majority in number of the votes cast for and against the motion with
//      each person having one vote for each lot in respect of which the
//      person is entitled to vote.
//      (2) Vote of original owner who owns more than half of lots to be
//      reduced For the purposes of determining an election for officers of
//      the owners corporation or members of the strata committee or
//      appointing a strata managing agent (other than in the case of a
//      poll), if the total unit entitlement of lots of the original owner is
//      not less than half of the aggregate unit entitlement, the value of
//      the vote in respect of the lots held by the original owner is taken
//      to be reduced by two-thirds (ignoring any fraction).

//      committee at the meeting, the motion is to be decided according to
//      the value of the votes cast for and against the motion and the value
//      of a vote cast by a person entitled to vote in respect of a lot is
//      equal to the unit entitlement of that lot. However, the value of the
//      vote of an original owner is to be calculated in the same way as for
//      a special resolution.

//           resolution is determined.
